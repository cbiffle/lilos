//! Timekeeping using the SysTick Timer.
//!
//! **Note:** this entire module is only available if the `systick` feature is
//! present; it is on by default.
//!
//! The OS uses the Cortex-M SysTick Timer to maintain a monotonic counter
//! recording the number of milliseconds ("ticks") since boot. This module
//! provides ways to read that timer, and also to arrange for tasks to be woken
//! at specific times (such as [`sleep_until`] and [`sleep_for`]).
//!
//! To use this facility in an application, you need to call the target-specific
//! initialize_sys_tick function to inform the OS of the system clock speed.
//! Otherwise, no operations in this module will work properly.
//!
//! You can get the value of tick counter using [`TickTime::now`].
//!
//! # Types for describing time
//!
//! This module uses three main types for describing time, in slightly different
//! roles.
//!
//! `TickTime` represents a specific point in time, measured as a number of
//! ticks since boot (or, really, since the executor was started). It's a
//! 64-bit count of milliseconds, which means it overflows every 584 million
//! years. This lets us ignore overflows in timestamps, making everything
//! simpler. `TickTime` is analogous to `std::time::Instant` from the Rust
//! standard library.
//!
//! `Millis` represents a relative time interval in milliseconds. This uses the
//! same representation as `TickTime`, so adding them together is cheap.
//!
//! `core::time::Duration` is similar to `Millis` but with a lot more bells and
//! whistles. It's the type used to measure time intervals in the Rust standard
//! library. It can be used with most time-related API in the OS, but you might
//! not want to do so on a smaller CPU: `Duration` uses a mixed-number-base
//! format internally that means almost all operations require a 64-bit multiply
//! or divide. On machines lacking such instructions, this can become quite
//! costly (in terms of both program size and time required).
//!
//! Cases where the OS won't accept `Duration` are mostly around things like
//! sleeps, where the operation will always be performed in units of whole
//! ticks, so being able to pass (say) nanoseconds is misleading.
//!
//! # Imposing a timeout on an operation
//!
//! If you want to stop a concurrent process if it's not done by a certain time,
//! see the [`with_deadline`] function (and its relative friend,
//! [`with_timeout`]). These let you impose a deadline on any future, such that
//! if it hasn't resolved by a certain time, it will be dropped (cancelled).
//!
//! # Fixing "lost ticks"
//!
//! If the longest sequence in your application between any two `await` points
//! takes less than a millisecond, the standard timer configuration will work
//! fine and keep reliable time.
//!
//! However, if you sometimes need to do more work than that -- or if you're
//! concerned you might do so by accident due to a bug -- the systick IRQ can be
//! configured to preempt task code. The OS is designed to handle this safely.
//! For more information, see
//! [`run_tasks_with_preemption`][crate::exec::run_tasks_with_preemption].
//!
//! # Getting higher precision
//!
//! For many applications, milliseconds are a fine unit of time, but sometimes
//! you need something more precise. Currently, the easiest way to do this is to
//! enlist a different hardware timer. The `time` module has no special
//! privileges that you can't make use of, and adding your own alternate
//! timekeeping module is explictly supported in the design (this is why the
//! `"systick"` feature exists).
//!
//! This can also be useful on processors like the Nordic nRF52 series, where
//! the best sleep mode to use when idling the CPU also stops the systick timer.
//! On platforms like that, the systick isn't useful as a monotonic clock, and
//! you'll want to use some other vendor-specific timer.
//!
//! Currently there's no example of how to do this in the repo. If you need
//! this, please file an issue.

/// let mut gate = PeriodicGate::from(Millis(30));
/// loop {
///     f();
///     gate.next_time().await;
/// }
/// ```

/// This will maintain the 30-millisecond interval consistently, even if `f()`
/// takes several milliseconds to run, and even if `f()` is sometimes fast and
/// sometimes slow. (If `f` sometimes takes more than 30 milliseconds, the next
/// execution will happen later than normal -- there's not a lot we can do about
/// that. However, as soon as calls to `f` take less than 30 milliseconds, we'll
/// return to the normal periodic timing.)
///
/// This is often, but not always, what you want in a timing loop.
///
/// - `PeriodicGate` has "catch-up" behavior that might not be what you want: if
///   one execution takes (say) 5 times longer than the chosen period, it will
///   frantically run 4 more just after it to "catch up." This attempts to
///   maintain a constant number of executions per unit time, but that might not
///   be what you want. (Note that you can _detect_ the "catch-up" behavior by
///   calling [`PeriodicGate::is_lagging`].)

///   different from `PeriodicGate`'s behavior.
