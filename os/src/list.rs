//! Doubly-linked intrusive lists for scheduling and waking.
//!
//! A [`List<T>`][List] keeps track of nodes (of type [`Node<T>`][Node]) that
//! each contain some value `T`. The list is kept in *sorted* order by comparing
//! the `T`s:
//!
//! - [`List::insert_and_wait`] traverses the list to insert the `Node` in its
//!   proper place, and then waits for the node to be kicked back out.
//! - [`List::wake_less_than`] starts at one end and removes every `Node` with a
//!   value less than a threshold.
//!
//! The sort order is used to order things by timestamps, but you may find other
//! uses for it.
//!
//! If you just want to keep things in a list, and don't care about order or
//! need to associate a timestamp, simply use `List<()>`. This disables the
//! sorting and removes the order-related fields from both the list and node.
//!
//! # How to use for sleep/wake
//!
//! The basics are straightforward: given a `List` tracking waiters on a
//! particular event, create a `Node` and `insert_and_wait` it. At some future
//! point in a concurrent process or interrupt handler, one of the `wake_*`
//! methods on `List` gets called, and the `Node` will be removed and its
//! associated `Waker` invoked, causing `insert_and_wait` to return.
//!
//! # Pinning
//!
//! Because `List` and `Node` create circular, self-referential data structures,
//! all operations require that they be
//! [pinned](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/pin/). Because we don't use the
//! heap, we provide ways to create and use pinned data structures on the stack.
//! This is, unfortunately, kind of involved -- but the
//! [`create_node!`][crate::create_node] and
//! [`create_list!`][crate::create_list] convenience macros help.
//!
//! Here is an example of creating a `Node`, since that's what user code creates
//! most often; see the sources for [`mutex`](crate::mutex) for a real-world
//! example.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! # fn foo() {
//! // This creates a local variable called "my_node"
//! os::create_node!(my_node, (), os::exec::noop_waker());
//!
//! // Join a wait list
//! wait_list.insert_and_wait(my_node.as_mut()).await;
//!
//! // All done, my_node can be dropped
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Creating a list or node is a three-step process. We'll use `Node` as a
//! running example here, but the same applies to `List`.
//!
//! 1. Create a partially-initialized version using [`Node::new`] and extract it
//!    from the `ManuallyDrop` container. This is unsafe, because the object
//!    you're now holding will dereference bogus pointers if dropped. This makes
//!    it very important to proceed to the next two steps *without doing
//!    anything else*, particularly anything that could panic.
//!
//! 2. Put the `Node` in its final resting place (which may be a local, or might
//!    be a field of a struct, etc.) and pin it. The
//!    [`pin!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/pin/macro.pin.html)
//!    macro makes doing this on the stack easier.
//!
//! 3. Finish setting it up by calling [`Node::finish_init`].
//!
//! While each of these steps is unsafe, if you do them in sequence without
//! panicking, the result can be used safely -- and so the `create_node!` and
//! `create_list!` macros themselves are safe.
//!
//! (These operations must be macros, not functions, because we can't return an
//! object by-value once it's pinned.)
//!
//! So, with that in mind, the fully-manual version of the example above reads
//! as follows:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! # fn foo() {
//! // Create a partially initialized node, pinned on the stack.
//! //
//! // Safety: this is safe as long as we fulfill the rest of the conditions
//! // required by Node::new before doing anything that could result in dropping
//! // the node, including `panic!` or `await`.
//! let mut my_node = core::pin::pin!(unsafe {
//!     core::mem::ManuallyDrop::into_inner(
//!         os::list::Node::new((), os::exec::noop_waker())
//!     )
//! });
//! // Finish initialization.
//! //
//! // Safety: this discharges the rest of the obligations laid out by
//! // Node::new.
//! unsafe {
//!     os::list::Node::finish_init(my_node.as_mut());
//! }
//!
//! // Join a wait list
//! wait_list.insert_and_wait(my_node.as_mut()).await;
//!
//! // All done, my_node can be dropped
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # How is this safe?
//!
//! The `List` API relies on *blocking* for safety. Because `insert_and_wait`
//! takes control away from the caller until the node is kicked back out of the
//! list, it is borrowing the `&mut Node` for the duration of its membership in
//! the list. If the API were instead `insert`, we'd return to the caller, who
//! is still holding a `&mut Node` -- a supposedly exclusive reference to a
//! structure that is now also reachable through the `List`!
//!
//! This is why there is no `insert` operation, or a `take` operation that
//! returns a node -- both operations would compromise memory safety.

// Implementation safety notes:
//
// The safety comments in this module reference the following invariants:
//
// Link Valid Invariant: all the link pointers (that is, `Node::prev` and
// `Node::next`) transitively reachable from either `List` or `Node` are valid /
// not dangling. We maintain this by only setting them to the addresses of
// pinned structures, and ensuring that the `Drop` impl of those pinned
// structures will remove their addresses from any link.
