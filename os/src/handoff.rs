//! Mechanism for handing data from one task to another, minimizing copies.
//!
//! There are two sides to a `Handoff<T>`, the sender and the receiver. When both
//! the sender and receiver are ready, a single `T` gets transferred from the
//! sender's ownership to the receiver's. In this case, "ready" means that
//! either the sender or receiver was already blocked waiting for its peer when
//! that peer arrived -- with both tasks waiting at the handoff, we can copy the
//! data and then unblock both.
//!
//! Because we don't need any sort of holding area for a copy of the `T`, a
//! `Handoff<T>` is very small -- about the size of two pointers.
//!
//! In computer science this is referred to as a _rendezvous_, but that's harder
//! to spell than handoff.
//!
//! # Creating and using a `Handoff`
//!
//! Because the `Handoff` itself contains no storage, they're cheap to create on
//! the stack. You then need to `split` then into their `Push` and `Pop` ends --
//! these both _borrow_ the `Handoff`, so you need to keep it around. You can
//! then hand the ends off to other futures. A typical use case looks like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut handoff = Handoff::new();
//! let (push, pop) = handoff.split();
//! join!(data_producer(push), data_consumer(pop));
//! ```
//!
//! If you just want to synchronize two tasks at a rendezvous point, and don't
//! need to move data, use `Handoff<()>`. It does the right thing.
//!
//! # Caveats and alternatives
//!
//! Only one `Push` and `Pop` can exist at a time -- the compiler ensures this.
//! This simplifies the implementation quite a bit, but it means that if you
//! want a multi-party rendezvous this isn't the right tool.
//!
//! If you would like to be able to push data and go on about your business
//! without waiting for it to be popped, you want a queue, not a handoff. See
//! the `spsc` module.
//!
//! Note that none of these types are `Send` or `Sync` -- they are very much not
//! thread safe, so they can be freely used across `async` tasks but cannot be
//! shared with an interrupt handler. For the same reason, you probably don't
//! want to attempt to store one in a `static` -- you will succeed with enough
//! `unsafe`, but the result will not be useful! The queues provided in `spsc`
//! do not have this limitation, at the cost of being more work to set up.
//!
//! # Cancel safety
//!
//! This module is currently the only part of `lilos` that has non-deprecated
//! API that is not strictly cancel-safe. This is often okay, the way handoffs
//! are used (in my code at least), but please read the docs for [`Push::push`]
//! carefully.
