//! Fair mutex that must be pinned.
//!
//! This implements a mutex (a kind of lock) guarding a value of type `T`.
//! Creating a `Mutex` by hand is somewhat involved (see [`Mutex::new`] for
//! details), so there's a convenience macro,
//! [`create_mutex!`][crate::create_mutex].
//!
//! If you don't want to store a value inside the mutex, use a `Mutex<()>`.
//!
//! # `lock` vs `lock_assuming_cancel_safe`
//!
//! This mutex API is subtly different from most other async mutex APIs in that
//! its default `lock` operation does _not_ return a "smart pointer" style mutex
//! guard that can `Deref` to access the guarded data. Instead, by default,
//! locking this mutex only grants you the ability to do a single action with
//! the guarded data, without being able to `await` during the action. There is
//! a very good reason for this, but it's subtle.
//!
//! You'd use this default `lock` API like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! some_mutex.lock().await.perform(|data| data.squirrels += 1);
//! ```
//!
//! That is, you call `.lock().await` to block until the mutex is yours, and
//! then call `perform` on the result to access the guarded data. The function
//! provided to `perform` must be a normal Rust `fn`, and _not_ an `async fn`.
//! The mutex is released as soon as `perform` runs your function. This means
//! there is no way to make alterations to the guarded data, `await`, and then
//! try and make more.
//!
//! This helps to avoid a common implementation mistake in software using
//! mutexes: assuming that you can temporarily violate invariants on the data
//! guarded by the mutex because you will restore things before you unlock it --
//! but then `await`ing (and thus accepting possible cancellation) while those
//! invariants are still being violated. This can cause the next observer of the
//! guarded data to find the data in an invalid state, often leading to panics
//! -- but _not_ panics in the code that had the bug! This makes the bug very
//! difficult to track down.
//!
//! To make this class of bugs harder to write, the default `lock` operation on
//! this mutex doesn't allow you to access the guarded data on two sides of an
//! `await` point.
//!
//! But because this doesn't cover every use case, and in keeping with the
//! broader OS philosophy of letting you do potentially dangerous but powerful
//! things, there's an _opt-in_ API that provides the traditional, smart-pointer
//! style interface. To use this API, you must create your mutex in a way that
//! asserts that you intend to keep its contents valid across any possible
//! cancellation point. As long as you do that, this API won't cause you any
//! problems.
//!
//! To assert this, wrap the guarded data in the [`CancelSafe`] wrapper type,
//! and write the mutex type as `Mutex<CancelSafe<T>>` instead of just
//! `Mutex<T>`. Then two new operations become available:
//! [`Mutex::lock_assuming_cancel_safe`] and
//! [`Mutex::try_lock_assuming_cancel_safe`]. These work in the traditional way
//! for more complex use cases.
//!
//! # Implementation details
//!
//! This implementation uses a wait-list to track all processes that are waiting
//! to unlock the mutex. (An OS task may contain many processes.) This makes
//! unlocking more expensive, but means that the unlock operation is *fair*,
//! preventing starvation of contending tasks.
//!
//! However, in exchange for this property, mutexes must be pinned, which makes
//! using them slightly more awkward. See the macros
//! [`create_mutex!`][crate::create_mutex] and
//! [`create_static_mutex!`][crate::create_static_mutex] for convenient
//! shorthand (or as examples of how to do it yourself).
