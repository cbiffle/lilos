# STM32F407 examples

These examples are targeted at the STM32F407-DISCOVERY evaluation board, or its
newer replacement, the STM32F407G-DISC1.

The only part of the examples that depends on the specific board is the pin
choices for things like LEDs and UARTs, so it ought to be possible to use these
on a different STM32F407 board by changing the pins used in the code.
