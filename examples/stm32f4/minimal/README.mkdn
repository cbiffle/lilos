# STM32F407 Minimal Example

Minimal example of using `lilos` to blink an LED at 1Hz on the
STM32F4DISCOVERY board.

This starts a single task, which uses the scheduler and timer to
periodically toggle a GPIO pin (D12, which is an LED on the STM32F4DISCOVERY
board).

This demonstrates

1. How to start the `lilos` executor and configure timekeeping.
2. How to perform periodic actions and delays.
3. How to safely share data on the stack with a task.
