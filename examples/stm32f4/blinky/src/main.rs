//! More complex LED-blinking demo using parameterized tasks.
//!
//! This blinks four LEDs on the STM32F4DISCOVERY board. Each LED uses the same
//! blink routine, but customized with different parameters to achieve different
//! frequencies and control different pins.
//!
//! The LEDs are expected to be on pins PD12-PD15.
//!
//! This example leaves out some detail compared to `minimal`, you may want to
//! read that one first.
//!
//! This demonstrates the stuff included in `minimal`, plus:
//!
//! 1. How to start multiple tasks.
//! 2. How to customize a single `async fn` to create multiple tasks with
//!    different behavior.
