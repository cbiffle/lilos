//! An example of receiving and retransmitting bytes through a UART on the
//! STM32F4xx.
//!
//! This defaults to using USART2, which is the one easily accessible on my
//! breakout board. Bytes received at 115200 baud will be retransmitted at the
//! same rate. 
//!
//! Wiring:
//! - PA2 is USART2 TX
//! - PA3 is USART2 RX
//! - PD12 is the heartbeat LED.
//!
//! This demonstrates the same stuff included in `blinky`, plus:
//!
//! 1. How to fork a task into multiple child tasks and then re-join.
//! 2. Use of queues to transfer data between concurrent processes (here, acting
//!    as a UART FIFO).
//! 3. Custom interrupt handlers and the use of `Notify`.
//!
//! # Theory of operation
//!
//! Here's what this does:
//!
//! - `main` sets up some hardware and then starts the `lilos` executor with two
//!   root tasks, `heartbeat` and `echo`.
//! - `heartbeat` periodically blinks an LED forever.
//! - `echo` configures USART2, creates a shared queue, and then forks into two
//!   concurrent processes `echo_tx` and `echo_rx`.
//! - `echo_rx` responds to received-data interrupts by copying bytes into the
//!   shared queue.
//! - `echo_tx` wakes when the queue is empty (and the USART's transmit data
//!   register is empty) and stuffs bytes into the USART.
//!
//! Because `lilos` uses `async` for concurrency, the implementation is
//! different from what you might see in a traditional RTOS. Each concurrent
//! process is still written as a straight-line function that loops when needed,
//! but the way they interact is different:
//!
//! - Unrelated tasks (like `heartbeat` and `echo`) are split into state that
//!   lives across `await` points, which is stored separately, and dynamic stack
//!   usage *between* `await` points, which reuses the same stack space. This
//!   means we need less overall stack allocation.
//!
//! - `echo` forking into `echo_tx` and `echo_rx` is quite literal: `echo` turns
//!   itself into two concurrent processes, reusing its resources, including
//!   loaning local variables into the two processes. This is very hard to
//!   do on a conventional RTOS, particularly if you want to do it safely.
