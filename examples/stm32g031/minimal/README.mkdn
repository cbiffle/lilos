# STM32G031 Minimal Example

Minimal example of using `lilos` to blink an LED at 1Hz on the NUCLEO-STM32G031
board.

This starts a single task, which uses the scheduler and timer to periodically
toggle a GPIO pin (C6, which is an LED on the NUCLEO-STM32G031 board).

This demonstrates

1. How to start the `lilos` executor and configure timekeeping.
2. How to perform periodic actions and delays.
3. How to safely share data on the stack with a task.
