//! An example of receiving and retransmitting bytes through a UART on the
//! STM32H7xx.
//!
//! This defaults to using USART3, which is conveniently wired to the "virtual
//! COM port" exposed over USB by the built-in STLink V3 programmer. Bytes
//! received at 115200 baud will be retransmitted at the same rate. 
//!
//! Wiring:
//! - PD8 is USART3 TX
//! - PD9 is USART3 RX
//! - PB0 is the heartbeat LED.
//!
//! This demonstrates the same stuff included in `minimal`, plus:
//!
//! 1. How to fork a task into multiple child tasks and then re-join.
//! 2. Use of queues to transfer data between concurrent processes (here,
//!    supplementing the UART FIFO).
//! 3. Custom interrupt handlers and the use of `Notify`.
//!
//! # Theory of operation
//!
//! Here's what this does:
//!
//! - `main` sets up some hardware and then starts the `lilos` executor with two
//!   root tasks, `heartbeat` and `echo`.
//! - `heartbeat` periodically blinks an LED forever.
//! - `echo` configures USART3, creates a shared queue, and then forks into two
//!   concurrent processes `echo_tx` and `echo_rx`.
//! - `echo_rx` responds to received-data interrupts by copying bytes into the
//!   shared queue.
//! - `echo_tx` wakes when the queue is empty (and the USART's transmit data
//!   register is empty) and stuffs bytes into the USART.
//!
//! Because `lilos` uses `async` for concurrency, the implementation is
//! different from what you might see in a traditional RTOS. Each concurrent
//! process is still written as a straight-line function that loops when needed,
//! but the way they interact is different:
//!
//! - Unrelated tasks (like `heartbeat` and `echo`) are split into state that
//!   lives across `await` points, which is stored separately, and dynamic stack
//!   usage *between* `await` points, which reuses the same stack space. This
//!   means we need less overall stack allocation.
//!
//! - `echo` forking into `echo_tx` and `echo_rx` is quite literal: `echo` turns
//!   itself into two concurrent processes, reusing its resources, including
//!   loaning local variables into the two processes. This is very hard to
//!   do on a conventional RTOS, particularly if you want to do it safely.
